Deepfakes are becoming more realistic and widespread. Detecting them quickly and reliably is important to protect privacy, maintain trust, and stop misuse of digital content. This project demonstrates a practical method using InceptionResnet CNN to address this growing problem.

This project is about detecting deepfakes, which are fake videos or images that look real and can be used to mislead people. Deepfakes are becoming more advanced, posing risks to privacy, security, and trust in digital media.
We use the Inception-ResNet model, a type of deep learning neural network, to detect these fakes. This model is good at analyzing both the visual details (spatial features) and the movement in videos (temporal features), which helps it tell apart real content from manipulated content.

It has been tested on famous Deepfake Dataset like Celeb DF, FF++ etc. It involves

1. Detecting fake videos and images accurately.
2. Works well on different datasets, including low-quality or compressed media.
3. Can be applied to social media, content verification, and other systems that need to check if media is real or fake.
4. Helps researchers and developers build safer tools to fight misinformation.
